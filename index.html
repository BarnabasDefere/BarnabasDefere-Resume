        <div class="subheading mb-5">Film Directorüì∑</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Barnabas Defere and here is an inside look in the mind of me. I typically go by Barny since people have a hard time saying or remembering my name, I am a TFDP major with a concentration in directing and I am a third-year student at UCR who transferred last fall from NorCal. I attended Skyline High School in Oakland, Ca. My plan after I graduate is to go directly into working as PA or a do internships whilst working other jobs to ground myself in film and to start thinking about directing some of my own films and probably present my film at film festivals not only branch out my expertise but also make more connections to work towards making a featured film, the ultimate goal is to have my film in theatres and have it be well recieved.<br><br>

        My hometown is Oakland California, which funny enough is referred to as The Town with San Francisco being referred to as The City, the thing I love about ‚ÄúThe Town‚Äù is definitely the community as everyone who lives in Oakland is with and for Oakland, I also love the Bart since it lets me travel really conveniently to other places in the Bay Area and the fact that SoCal doesn't have something like that is slightly upsetting. My fondest memory of Oakland is the Dub Nation parade that was held downtown in commemoration of the Warriors winning the championship as well as just that all my friends and family are in Oakland or close enough for me to take the Bart to them. The culture is hyphy and the food is good especially all the food trucks in Oakland. The particular season I enjoy the most is Christmas and that is due to the weather being colder and me, my family, and friends come together and we have a holly jolly Christmas. To be honest anyplace in Oakland is cool as long as you are with friends and family, just try not to get shot.<br><br>

        Some hobbies of mine is playing music, playing games, watching movies/cartoons/tv shows/anime ext. And just overall goofing off in discord with a bunch of buddies of mine. I don't go on hikes, I‚Äôm very antisocial and will only go out for necessities or I'm being forced to by my parents or friends. Another hobby of mine is cooking given that I spent a lot of time at home alone and so I like to cook to get better and also to generally eat because I get hungry. Also UCR has a lot of clubs and fraternities that I would love to be a part of however have no time to attend however I really enjoy the src and the rock climbing wall and boulder that they have. I also really enjoy how riverside is close to every other place within an hour's distance away and like to go to la for annual film festivals.
